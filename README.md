Overview
Reflex Racer is a fun and engaging arcade game built using an Arduino microcontroller. The game challenges players to respond quickly to visual and auditory cues, aiming to improve their reflexes and reaction times.

System Architecture
The system architecture of Reflex Racer includes the following components:

Arduino Microcontroller: The brain of the game, handling inputs and outputs.
LEDs: Provide visual cues for the player.
Buzzer: Provides auditory cues.
Buttons: Used by the player to interact with the game.
Implementation
The implementation of Reflex Racer involves the following steps:

Setting up the Arduino: Install the necessary libraries and configure the hardware.
Programming the Game Logic: Write the code to handle the game mechanics, including timing and scoring.
Assembling the Hardware: Connect the LEDs, buzzer, and buttons to the Arduino according to the circuit diagram.
Testing and Evaluation
To ensure the game functions correctly, thorough testing is conducted:

Unit Testing: Test individual components like LEDs, buzzer, and buttons.
Integration Testing: Ensure all components work together seamlessly.
User Testing: Gather feedback from players to refine the game experience.
